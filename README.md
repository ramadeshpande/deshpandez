# deshpandez.com (a.k.a journey or jrny)

## Description
This is an Angular app where the code is up to date with the deployed version of www.deshpandez.com. The system is called "journey" or "jrny" and it is meant to be an AI productivity dashboard/assistant. 

## Installation
You can fork the repository and build on top of it for non-commercial use. The code can be downloaded and tested with the following commands:
- cd jrny-app
- npm install
- cd src/app
- ng serve

This will run the code and work for everything except for the environment variable of the Gemini API key, which is only called from the gitlab-ci.yml build stage through a CI/CD workflow.

## Support
You can contact rama@deshpandez.com to request further debugging or instructions to run the code. 

## Roadmap
The code is still under development. New features are added every week. Login is buggy and will be fixed shortly, and logout will be added soon as well.

## License
This is an open source, GNUv3 license. If you choose to fork this code, it is expected that your project is under the same GNU v3 license!
